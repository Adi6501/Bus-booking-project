The Bus Booking System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate efficient, user-friendly bus ticket reservations for travelers. Built with an intuitive user interface, the system allows users to search for available buses, select routes, and reserve tickets with ease. Developed in Visual Studio Code, the project incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive front end that displays travel details, schedules, and seat availability in real-time.

The platform features a secure backend for sign-in and user account management, ensuring data integrity and privacy. With the backend in place, users can log in, view their booking history, and manage reservations. Additional features, like payment integration and real-time updates on bus schedules, can enhance the system's functionality, providing a comprehensive solution for travelers and bus operators alike.

The Bus Booking System aims to improve the user experience of booking bus travel, making it faster, more accessible, and more organized, while potentially reducing manual processes for operators.
